## Assignment 2: Blog

### Blog Topic Summary

I was unsure of what to make this topic, but I wanted to display my knowledge of horses--and latin.

### Key Takeaways

This was actually a bit tricky! I had to google a couple things (how to make things centered) because I am definitely not a coder, and I had to play around with styling with empty, colored div's. I need to work on clean code and having it more organized than it currently is.
